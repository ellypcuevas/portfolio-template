    <h1>Elly Cuevas CS Project Portfolio</h1>      
    <p>I will be attending Pomona College in the Fall to pursue a career in neuroscience and explore computer science. I love how computer science is like a puzzle, only it allows you to create whatever you wish. As a problem solver, the rush that computer science  fuels me to continue trying to solve any erros when they arrive.</p>

        <p>Our project is inspired by the web game MovieStarPlanet. The goal of our game is to allow the player to have creative liberty and design outfits as they wish with what is provided. This demonstrates the skill to design outfits and put together clothing.</p>
